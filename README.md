This site currently contains two online documentation books for Ruby:

* [The Ruby Reference](https://rubyreferences.github.io/rubyref/): full language reference, compiled in a readable form from official sources.
* [Ruby Changes](https://rubyreferences.github.io/rubychanges/): detailed language changelog (currently for 2.6 only, but it will be expanded to older and newer versions eventually)

Source of this page is available at [GitHub repo](https://github.com/rubyreferences/rubyreferences.github.io), as well as the source for [all sub-sites](https://github.com/rubyreferences).
